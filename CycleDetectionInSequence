"""
Given a sequence, write a program to detect cycles within it.
Input:
Your program should read lines of text from standard input. 
Each line will contain a sequence of space delimited numbers, which can have multiple digits (e.g., 12). Ignore empty lines.
Output:
For each line of input, print to standard output the first cycle you find. 
Ensure that there are no trailing spaces on each line you print.
